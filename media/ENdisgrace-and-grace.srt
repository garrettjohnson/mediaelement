1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,500


2
00:00:01,583 --> 00:00:11,500
[music]

3
00:00:15,167 --> 00:00:22,000
Father God,
I ask that

4
00:00:22,042 --> 00:00:26,458
I'd be able to teach well today.

5
00:00:30,667 --> 00:00:36,708
And, God, I hope that
you would help Mars Hill

6
00:00:36,792 --> 00:00:43,375
to be a place where hurting
people are served.

7
00:00:43,667 --> 00:00:47,333
And I pray, Lord God,

8
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:52,333
for those who will hear
this sermon,

9
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:56,833
some helping them along
a journey toward healing,

10
00:00:56,875 --> 00:01:00,958
and those who will start
a journey of healing,

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:05,958
but with the first steps
being incredibly painful.

12
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,583
God, I thank you for my wife's
bravery in writing

13
00:01:13,667 --> 00:01:16,958
the seventh chapter
of the "Real Marriage" book,

14
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:20,875
and I thank you that I have
the great honor of teaching

15
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:25,583
that content today,
and I thank you, Lord,

16
00:01:25,667 --> 00:01:29,958
that she is a great gift
that you've given to me.

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,333
And so, God I pray
that this time

18
00:01:33,417 --> 00:01:36,292
would be focused on
helping others

19
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,667
and that you would allow
me to finish this sermon.

20
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,833
Amen.

21
00:01:43,875 --> 00:01:49,500
This is the one sermon
I never wanted to preach.

22
00:01:56,083 --> 00:01:59,208
Grace and I were
sitting on a couch.

23
00:01:59,292 --> 00:02:03,583
It was late one night,
just hanging out,

24
00:02:03,667 --> 00:02:08,750
and we--just visiting,

25
00:02:08,833 --> 00:02:12,000
nothing particularly deep.

26
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:15,667
And I started asking her a few
questions about some issues

27
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:18,792
in her past
and experiences that she'd had,

28
00:02:18,833 --> 00:02:21,583
and she just answered
them matter-of-factly,

29
00:02:21,667 --> 00:02:26,000
just very casually,
very unemotionally,

30
00:02:26,042 --> 00:02:30,375
and I just started bawling.

31
00:02:30,458 --> 00:02:32,375
And she was taken aback.

32
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:34,833
She couldn't understand
why I was emotional.

33
00:02:34,917 --> 00:02:37,583
I don't get emotional
very often.

34
00:02:37,667 --> 00:02:41,000
Almost always, if I do, it's
because women and children

35
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:43,417
are in danger.

36
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:47,333
And she said,
"Oh, I'm so sorry."

37
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:49,000
I said, "No, don't be sorry.

38
00:02:49,042 --> 00:02:50,625
"You didn't do anything wrong.

39
00:02:50,667 --> 00:02:53,500
"You didn't say anything wrong,

40
00:02:53,542 --> 00:02:56,583
but you're
a sexual assault victim."

41
00:02:56,667 --> 00:02:58,000
And she's like, "What me?

42
00:02:58,042 --> 00:02:59,583
What are you talking about?"

43
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,000
I said, "Yeah, what you just
explained was

44
00:03:02,042 --> 00:03:03,875
textbook sexual assault."

45
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:07,083
And all of a sudden, everything
in our marriage and relationship

46
00:03:07,167 --> 00:03:08,667
made sense.

47
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:12,000
We had been married,
at that point, for--

48
00:03:12,042 --> 00:03:13,583
gosh, it was 6 years ago.

49
00:03:13,667 --> 00:03:16,375
This year, we'll celebrate
our 20th wedding anniversary.

50
00:03:16,458 --> 00:03:20,750
So, we were married at
that point, maybe 13-14 years.

51
00:03:20,833 --> 00:03:23,167
And we dated for
4 1/2 years before we married,

52
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:25,292
so we'd been together
17 or 18 years.

53
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:27,750
I mean, I'd known Grace
since high school,

54
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,292
and we were good friends.

55
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:33,375
And now I knew her.

56
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,667
I knew everything.

57
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:38,083
And she hadn't
concealed anything,

58
00:03:38,167 --> 00:03:41,583
so she wasn't ever
dishonest with me.

59
00:03:41,667 --> 00:03:44,083
She just never saw
it for what it was.

60
00:03:44,167 --> 00:03:46,833
And I think that's pretty common
with victims not only of

61
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,375
sexual assault, but of
other kinds of assault, as well,

62
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:52,708
that sometimes you tend to
be more clear perspective seeing

63
00:03:52,792 --> 00:03:55,417
someone else's life, but
you interpret the data

64
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,417
in your own life differently.

65
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,500
And sometimes
there'll be repressed memory,

66
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:01,375
where you don't remember
certain things,

67
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,750
and then something will
trigger it, or disassociation,

68
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:08,042
which is a clinical term, where
somebody who's being assaulted

69
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:10,667
in some particular
way, they'll disassociate.

70
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:14,458
They'll sort of mentally check
out, just as a coping mechanism.

71
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,542
And sometimes people are
just not emotionally ready

72
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:22,083
to remember and deal
with certain trauma or trouble.

73
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:26,542
And I believe that God doesn't
give us more than we can bear,

74
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:30,042
and for those who come to
understand some things

75
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,000
that have been done to them,

76
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:34,292
sometimes it
is because they're finally

77
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,542
at a place in their maturity
in Christ that they could,

78
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:40,458
they could handle it.

79
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,042
And so, in some regards,
I guess it's an encouragement,

80
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,292
meaning we're finally
ready to deal with this.

81
00:04:45,333 --> 00:04:47,417
Well, it was one
of those moments,

82
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:51,833
where I knew
what had happened to my wife,

83
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:57,000
and . . .

84
00:04:57,083 --> 00:05:00,833
and it was devastating.

85
00:05:00,917 --> 00:05:05,667
And--because for me,
I'm like a lot of you men,

86
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,667
I'm a defender, protector.

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,375
Like, the safety of my wife and
kids is the highest priority,

88
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:17,875
and to realize that I wasn't
there until 17--and some things

89
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:21,583
happened to her before 17,
before I'd met her--

90
00:05:21,667 --> 00:05:25,583
it really bothered me that
I wasn't there to protect her.

91
00:05:25,667 --> 00:05:27,458
It still does.

92
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,375
And so we started reading,
and talking, and praying,

93
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:36,333
and trying to figure out,
"What do we do now?"

94
00:05:36,417 --> 00:05:40,667
I had Grace start journaling out
all of the related experiences

95
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:44,667
in her life, because she'd
never really thought about it.

96
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,833
She'd have a thought
here or a grief moment there,

97
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:50,500
but the business of life
would just sort of compel her

98
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:51,917
to proceed forward.

99
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,667
So, I said, "Honey, I really
need you to take

100
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,083
a couple of days."

101
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:58,292
And I put her
in a safe, quiet hotel

102
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,833
and stayed in contact with her,

103
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,083
but I took care of the kids
and took care of the house

104
00:06:03,167 --> 00:06:05,292
and said, "Honey, I just need
you to focus

105
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,292
"and journal this out, and think
this out, and pray this out,

106
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:11,000
so we get an idea of what
exactly we're dealing with."

107
00:06:11,042 --> 00:06:13,333
Because she'd never really given
herself time to process

108
00:06:13,417 --> 00:06:14,750
and to grieve.

109
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:19,333
And then we started studying
and looking for ways to work out

110
00:06:19,417 --> 00:06:22,083
what had happened to her.

111
00:06:22,167 --> 00:06:25,667
And we met a couple of times
with a biblical counselor.

112
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,000
"Okay, what do we
need to do, not do?

113
00:06:28,042 --> 00:06:31,000
"What's a good course
of action for us, so I can love,

114
00:06:31,042 --> 00:06:33,333
and serve, and help my wife?"

115
00:06:33,417 --> 00:06:37,500
And in the grace of God,
some years later--

116
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:39,167
I mean, our friendship is great.

117
00:06:39,208 --> 00:06:42,500
Our marriage is
really fantastic.

118
00:06:42,542 --> 00:06:46,625
It kind of was a revealing
moment at Christmas,

119
00:06:46,667 --> 00:06:49,417
when, with the kids,
we were all in a circle,

120
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:52,625
and we were talking and praying,
and I asked each of the kids,

121
00:06:52,667 --> 00:06:54,917
"What are you most
thankful for?"

122
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,500
And my oldest daughter,
she smiled and she said,

123
00:06:58,542 --> 00:07:01,958
"I'm thankful that you and Mom
are never going to get divorced,

124
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,583
because you're best friends."

125
00:07:05,667 --> 00:07:09,792
And that's where we're at.

126
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:12,167
That being said, when
it came time to write

127
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:15,000
the "Real Marriage" book, she really
wanted to help people,

128
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:19,667
and she really loves people,
and she's very brave,

129
00:07:19,708 --> 00:07:25,500
and she wanted to
basically say, "If I'm honest,

130
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,292
"then other people
can be honest,

131
00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:29,458
"and if this has happened to
other people,

132
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,292
I want to help them and
encourage them to get help."

133
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:35,667
And so her motives are
very good and very, very pure,

134
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,875
and I really appreciate
her courage.

135
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:43,667
So, the subject matter for
this sermon is going to be

136
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,375
the content that she wrote,

137
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:49,250
and I'll start by
doing something

138
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:54,792
that I think is important, and
that is defining sexual assault.

139
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:57,542
It comes from this book,
"Rid of My Disgrace"

140
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,958
by Justin and Lindsey Holcomb.

141
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,833
He's a pastor here
at Mars Hill

142
00:08:01,917 --> 00:08:03,708
and runs Resurgence for us.

143
00:08:03,792 --> 00:08:06,250
His wife, Lindsey,
is also a leader in the church.

144
00:08:06,333 --> 00:08:10,667
She's a deacon, and she was a
rape crisis clinic case manager,

145
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:14,833
and he taught women's studies
at the University of Virginia

146
00:08:14,917 --> 00:08:18,500
and is a specialist in sexual
assault and domestic violence.

147
00:08:18,542 --> 00:08:21,833
And Grace and I actually
asked them to write this book,

148
00:08:21,917 --> 00:08:26,542
because we wanted to have, from
our church, a good Bible-based,

149
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:30,083
Jesus-focused resource to help
people who have been

150
00:08:30,167 --> 00:08:31,500
sexually assaulted.

151
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,583
And we love that book,
and, you know, endorsed it,

152
00:08:34,667 --> 00:08:37,958
and all of that, and are really
honored that that comes from

153
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,750
Mars Hill Church.

154
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:43,875
And their definition is,
"Any type of sexual behavior

155
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:48,167
"or contact where consent is not
freely given or obtained

156
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:51,292
"and is accomplished through
force, intimidation, violence,

157
00:08:51,333 --> 00:08:53,792
coercion, manipulation,
threat--"

158
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,375
hold it right there, guys--

159
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,375
"deception,
or abuse of authority."

160
00:08:57,458 --> 00:08:59,250
So, that's what
we're talking about.

161
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:02,458
It's very important, because it
used to be that the word "rape"

162
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,833
was used a lot, and it still
is, but this is a larger, legal,

163
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:11,667
clinical definition, and it's
important that as you look at

164
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,000
your life, or your spouse,
or people you know and love,

165
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:17,208
that you understand
what has happened

166
00:09:17,292 --> 00:09:19,333
and have the right language.

167
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,333
We don't want to falsely
accuse anyone; at the same time,

168
00:09:22,417 --> 00:09:25,333
we don't want to
falsely excuse anyone.

169
00:09:25,417 --> 00:09:29,333
And it manifests
itself in three ways.

170
00:09:29,375 --> 00:09:33,458
"The 'acts' can be physical,
verbal, or psychological."

171
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:35,833
In the age
of bullying and the Internet,

172
00:09:35,917 --> 00:09:39,333
in the age of certain
inappropriate speech

173
00:09:39,417 --> 00:09:42,667
and conduct, it just, it can be
physical contact

174
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,833
that connotes sexual assault,

175
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:46,750
but it doesn't
necessarily have to be.

176
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,708
It also can be verbal
and/or psychological.

177
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:53,833
And some of you will ask,
"Man, a whole sermon on this?

178
00:09:53,917 --> 00:09:55,333
"Why is this necessary?

179
00:09:55,417 --> 00:09:57,125
"I've been to a lot of churches,

180
00:09:57,167 --> 00:09:59,125
and I've not heard them
talk about this."

181
00:09:59,167 --> 00:10:01,625
I would say, I love them,
but that's their failure.

182
00:10:01,667 --> 00:10:04,167
I was talking with
a very well-known pastor of

183
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,000
a decent-sized church,
and he asked this question

184
00:10:08,042 --> 00:10:09,667
some years ago of me.

185
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,667
He asked, "Why do you guys talk
about sexual assault so much

186
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,083
in your church?"

187
00:10:14,167 --> 00:10:16,292
Well, part of it is
it's my wife's story.

188
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,458
Part of it is, as you'll
see in a moment, it's epidemic.

189
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:22,583
I said, "Well, isn't it
an issue in your church?"

190
00:10:22,667 --> 00:10:25,167
And at the time, I think
he had 800 people.

191
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:28,583
He said, "Well, I know of
two or three women who have been

192
00:10:28,667 --> 00:10:31,375
sexually assaulted, but it's
not a big issue at our church."

193
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,083
I said,
"You've not done your homework.

194
00:10:33,167 --> 00:10:36,167
"You don't know your people.

195
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,875
"You are ignoring a problem
and assuming there isn't one.

196
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:42,375
"That means you have a culture
in which the people

197
00:10:42,458 --> 00:10:46,375
"can't be honest about what has
been happening to them

198
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,333
and get the help
that they need."

199
00:10:48,417 --> 00:10:51,167
I said, "So, it's not
that you don't have a problem;

200
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,250
it's that you're
ignorant of a crisis."

201
00:10:53,333 --> 00:10:55,167
And, really, that's the issue,

202
00:10:55,208 --> 00:10:57,500
that sexual assault
is an epidemic.

203
00:10:57,542 --> 00:11:00,167
It's one in four women.

204
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:02,458
How many women do you know?

205
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,917
One in four.

206
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:09,667
Statistically, the younger
they are, the more likely it is.

207
00:11:09,708 --> 00:11:12,583
It's also true for
one in six men,

208
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:16,458
and men are highly unlikely to
report it for reasons

209
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:22,167
of shame and embarrassment,
and so it's not just women.

210
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:28,583
Ten to fourteen percent of wives
are assaulted by their husbands,

211
00:11:28,667 --> 00:11:33,375
which means
some women are not only victims;

212
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,750
they're married to their abuser,

213
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:39,792
which is a situation
I would liken to torment.

214
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:42,333
Abuse is what happens
when something is done to you,

215
00:11:42,417 --> 00:11:44,000
but you escape.

216
00:11:44,042 --> 00:11:46,333
Torment is where it
keeps happening to you,

217
00:11:46,417 --> 00:11:48,500
and you're trapped.

218
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:53,542
For some women,
marriage is torment.

219
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:56,667
They live with their abuser.

220
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,583
And it wasn't actually until
the '70s that the laws

221
00:11:59,667 --> 00:12:03,833
even began to recognize
marital sexual assault,

222
00:12:03,917 --> 00:12:09,667
that it was even a crime
for a man to abuse his wife.

223
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:14,375
Assault is also more common in
cohabitation than in marriage.

224
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:17,583
And some of you say, "That's
why I don't want to get married.

225
00:12:17,667 --> 00:12:19,583
I just want to live
with my boyfriend."

226
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:22,500
A boyfriend is far more likely
to sexually assault a girlfriend

227
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:26,292
than a husband is
to assault a wife.

228
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:28,875
And here's
the staggering statistic.

229
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:33,167
Only 5-40% of cases
are ever actually reported.

230
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,500
Grace's would be an example.

231
00:12:36,542 --> 00:12:40,583
It's never been reported,
not criminally speaking.

232
00:12:40,667 --> 00:12:43,083
So, you look at
the underreporting.

233
00:12:43,167 --> 00:12:47,958
Well, statistically, what that
means is a large percentage

234
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,083
of women and men,
who call Mars Hill Church home,

235
00:12:51,167 --> 00:12:53,833
have been sexually assaulted.

236
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:58,375
What that means is
if it's not part of your story,

237
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:02,542
it is part of the story
of someone you know.

238
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:04,542
I mean,
how many women do you know?

239
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,042
How many men do you know?

240
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:10,167
How many do you know closely,
and intimately, and personally?

241
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:13,000
Well, statistically,
you know a lot of victims,

242
00:13:13,042 --> 00:13:15,375
and you probably don't
know that they're victims,

243
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:18,167
because sometimes they don't
have the language to understand

244
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,958
what has happened to them,
or the shame has caused them

245
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,292
not to really talk about that.

246
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:26,667
And so at Mars Hill Church,
we want to be a place where

247
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:31,458
it's safe for people to be
honest about what has happened,

248
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:34,083
so that they can get hope,
and help, and healing

249
00:13:34,167 --> 00:13:36,167
through Jesus and his people.

250
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,542
It's a big part of what we do.

251
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,750
And I'll just say
this practically.

252
00:13:40,833 --> 00:13:42,875
I see it undergirding
lots of issues.

253
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:45,167
When we deal with people
that have drug problems,

254
00:13:45,250 --> 00:13:47,792
alcohol problems,
sexual addiction problems,

255
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,792
major depression problems,
not always, but oftentimes,

256
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:54,167
an underlying cause is
a past sexual assault.

257
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,792
It's amazing how this epidemic
manifests itself

258
00:13:57,833 --> 00:14:01,958
in other kinds of suffering.

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,042
Now, what happens to those who
are assault victims--

260
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:10,500
and this can be sexual
assault, physical assault,

261
00:14:10,542 --> 00:14:15,833
various kinds of abuse--what
tends to happen is they have,

262
00:14:15,917 --> 00:14:19,000
oftentimes, basically,
an identity crisis, like,

263
00:14:19,042 --> 00:14:22,375
"Who am I?"

264
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:27,875
And so Grace rightly
communicates in the chapter

265
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:30,458
that there are
four masks that they will wear,

266
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:33,750
and this is an identity
that they assume.

267
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:36,667
And like an actor or an actress
reading a script and playing

268
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:42,083
a role, they will try to cope
with what's happened to them

269
00:14:42,167 --> 00:14:44,667
by acting out in one
of these four ways.

270
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,167
The first is a good person.

271
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:50,000
And the underlying
logic is, basically,

272
00:14:50,042 --> 00:14:55,000
"Something very bad happened
to me, but I'm a good person.

273
00:14:55,042 --> 00:14:57,083
"They're a bad person.
I'm a good person.

274
00:14:57,167 --> 00:15:00,167
"They did a bad thing,
so I'm going to do good things.

275
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,750
I'm a good person."

276
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,833
These people tend to show
up early to work, stay late,

277
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:08,000
work hard, super faithful,
volunteer for everything,

278
00:15:08,042 --> 00:15:11,375
absolutely dependable,
sometimes very organized,

279
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:13,500
because it's
an issue of control.

280
00:15:13,542 --> 00:15:16,375
They felt like much of
their life was out of control,

281
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:19,083
and they want to keep as much
of it as possible

282
00:15:19,167 --> 00:15:21,458
under their control.

283
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,583
These are people
who are moral, they're obedient,

284
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:27,500
they're compliant, they're
dependable, they're reliable.

285
00:15:27,542 --> 00:15:31,292
They're good people outwardly.

286
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:34,333
It's not bad to be good,

287
00:15:34,417 --> 00:15:39,458
but the motive is bad
for them being good.

288
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,958
They're trying to show,
"I'm a good person,

289
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,958
and what happened
didn't affect how good I am."

290
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,333
Sometimes it's the people
who volunteer the most,

291
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:55,542
and give the most, and serve the
most that are hurting the most,

292
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,667
and they're hiding.

293
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,750
Number two,
there's the religious person.

294
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:07,208
These people make everything
incredibly, overtly spiritual.

295
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:12,292
These are the people
that it's always

296
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:16,667
out-of-context Bible verses.

297
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,000
They'll talk about
Satan and demons

298
00:16:19,042 --> 00:16:20,792
and the sovereignty of God,

299
00:16:20,833 --> 00:16:22,792
and "he's going to
work it all out,"

300
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,375
and "when he closes a door,
he opens a window,"

301
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:28,333
and "greater is he who
is in you than he who is

302
00:16:28,417 --> 00:16:31,958
in the world," and "I'm more
than a conqueror in Christ."

303
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,167
And you ask them,
"How are you doing?"

304
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:37,167
They'll say, "God works out all
things for the good of those

305
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,583
who love him."

306
00:16:38,667 --> 00:16:40,583
It's like, "You didn't
even answer my question.

307
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:44,083
"You're using theology
as a fig leaf to hide behind.

308
00:16:44,167 --> 00:16:46,250
"I can't even know you.

309
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:52,167
I know what you think;
I don't know who you are."

310
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,667
And sometimes they mean well,
and sometimes they love

311
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:59,292
the Lord, but they just,
they just don't know what to do.

312
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,458
And sometimes it's even an
error in the way the gospel is

313
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,167
presented, because sometimes the
gospel is presented solely as,

314
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:07,000
"If you sin, Jesus died.

315
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:09,000
Tell him your sin.
He'll forgive you."

316
00:17:09,042 --> 00:17:12,167
True, but what about, not
just the sins you've committed,

317
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,792
but the sins that
have been committed against you?

318
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:17,000
What do you do with those?

319
00:17:17,042 --> 00:17:20,167
You can't pray,
"Dear God, please forgive me

320
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:24,958
for being raped,"
because you didn't do anything.

321
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:31,000
You're the victim, not
the perpetrator of the offense.

322
00:17:31,042 --> 00:17:34,833
But some people
become incredibly religious,

323
00:17:34,917 --> 00:17:39,167
and I would say some
of the most devoutly religious,

324
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:42,875
hyper-spiritual people
that Grace and I have ever dealt

325
00:17:42,958 --> 00:17:46,542
with, as we get to know
them, they've been assaulted,

326
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:51,000
and they've
not really worked that through.

327
00:17:51,042 --> 00:17:53,500
There's the party person.

328
00:17:53,542 --> 00:17:56,583
One gal in a tragic counseling
appointment early on

329
00:17:56,667 --> 00:18:02,000
in my ministry articulated
it most devastatingly.

330
00:18:02,083 --> 00:18:06,542
I still pray for her often and
recently bumped into someone

331
00:18:06,625 --> 00:18:12,458
who knows her, and she's
not walking with Jesus,

332
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,458
but people are still talking
to her over a decade later.

333
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,292
She was an assault victim
and a young woman,

334
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,667
probably early 20s,
if memory serves me correct,

335
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,375
and I was meeting with her.

336
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:28,458
She was just doing some really
outrageous things

337
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:30,583
that were very dangerous.

338
00:18:30,667 --> 00:18:35,958
And I remember asking her,
I said, "Why do you do this?"

339
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,333
And she looked at me,
and she said, quote,

340
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:43,125
"I'm a dirty girl,
so I do dirty things."

341
00:18:50,458 --> 00:18:52,667
That's what her
grandfather made her say,

342
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:58,458
when he would leave
her room at night.

343
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:02,708
And she decided that that
would be her identity,

344
00:19:02,792 --> 00:19:05,125
so she would be
the life of the party.

345
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:08,708
She's gregarious, hilarious.

346
00:19:08,792 --> 00:19:11,500
She's fun to be around.

347
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,458
She's got
the best sense of humor ever,

348
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:19,833
but everything's a joke, and
she's always ready to just put

349
00:19:19,917 --> 00:19:23,917
a drink in her hand and let
her be the center of attention.

350
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,833
And it's not a sin
to have a good sense of humor,

351
00:19:26,875 --> 00:19:29,667
and it's not a sin to go out
and, you know,

352
00:19:29,708 --> 00:19:36,000
enjoy people and their company,
but for her, it's tragic.

353
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,958
Some of you are like that.

354
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,958
Everything is a joke.

355
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,750
You start talking about personal
things, change the subject,

356
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,917
throw out a punch line.

357
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,667
"Ah, let's go do something fun.

358
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:51,917
Why are you so serious?"

359
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,750
Number four, there's
the tough person,

360
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:56,667
and the tough person
has learned,

361
00:19:56,708 --> 00:19:59,000
"Somebody got close to
me and really hurt me.

362
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:02,250
I'm going to make sure
nobody ever gets close again."

363
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:04,417
They could be physically
intimidating.

364
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,417
They can be emotionally
intimidating.

365
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,500
They can be verbally
intimidating, like,

366
00:20:08,542 --> 00:20:10,042
"You keep your distance."

367
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,333
Sometimes,
they're just cold and aloof.

368
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:15,083
You know, like, "Man,
I don't even know that person.

369
00:20:15,167 --> 00:20:17,083
They don't open up at all."

370
00:20:17,167 --> 00:20:19,750
Other times, there's
an aura about them, like,

371
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,375
"Don't get too close."

372
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:26,333
If you start to impose
in any way

373
00:20:26,417 --> 00:20:31,958
that they feel uncomfortable,
you are going to pay.

374
00:20:34,167 --> 00:20:37,000
How about you?

375
00:20:37,042 --> 00:20:39,000
For those of you
who are assault victims

376
00:20:39,042 --> 00:20:40,375
of various sorts and kinds,

377
00:20:40,458 --> 00:20:43,375
you know, what mask do you
wear? What role do you play?

378
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:45,000
What identity have you assumed?

379
00:20:45,042 --> 00:20:46,875
And when it comes
to our identity,

380
00:20:46,958 --> 00:20:49,542
our identity
determines our testimony.

381
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:54,083
Who we think we are determines,
really, how we live.

382
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,792
And there's
really only three options.

383
00:20:55,833 --> 00:21:02,000
There's what I've done,
what they've done,

384
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:06,542
or what [God's] done.

385
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:09,667
"If it's what I've done,
well, then I'm going to try

386
00:21:09,750 --> 00:21:13,500
"to be a good person or
a religious person,

387
00:21:13,542 --> 00:21:18,583
and I'm going to try and
make myself a better person."

388
00:21:18,667 --> 00:21:20,792
If it's what they've done,

389
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,458
"I'm going to be a party
person or a tough person.

390
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,167
"Well, I'm damaged goods.
I may as well have fun," or

391
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:27,583
"I was hurt once,

392
00:21:27,667 --> 00:21:31,875
but I'll protect myself
from here on out."

393
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:35,083
Your identity comes
either from what you've done,

394
00:21:35,167 --> 00:21:39,667
what they've done,
or what [God's] done.

395
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:45,375
So, how does Jesus
play into all of this?

396
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,958
At this point,
we don't have good news, right?

397
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,792
You need some good news.

398
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:55,042
So far, all we've got is news.

399
00:21:55,125 --> 00:22:00,250
And I want to tell you
three things related to Jesus,

400
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:04,417
and that is, number one,
that Jesus forgives all sin.

401
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,833
So, some of you
are going to hear this,

402
00:22:06,917 --> 00:22:09,083
and you're going to say,
"I'm not the victim.

403
00:22:09,167 --> 00:22:11,667
I'm the sinner."

404
00:22:11,708 --> 00:22:13,667
Or maybe you're both.

405
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:16,833
Maybe, "Something was done to me,
and then I turned around and did

406
00:22:16,917 --> 00:22:19,792
something to someone else,"
or "Something was done to me,

407
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:23,875
and I've just been
bitter ever since."

408
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:26,958
What do you do with that?

409
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,542
1 John 1:7-8,
"If we walk in the light--"

410
00:22:30,625 --> 00:22:34,500
and this is about openness,
and honesty, and authenticity,

411
00:22:34,542 --> 00:22:39,500
which requires a lot of humility
to say, "Okay, here's who I am.

412
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:43,667
Here's what I've done."

413
00:22:43,750 --> 00:22:47,000
It's being honest
and transparent.

414
00:22:47,042 --> 00:22:52,167
And one of the reasons I admire
Grace so much for writing

415
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:56,667
the chapter in the book and
being honest about her story

416
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:59,292
is she's walking in the light.

417
00:22:59,333 --> 00:23:02,042
She's saying,
"Here's what happened."

418
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:08,500
And in so doing, she's inviting
other people to do the same.

419
00:23:08,542 --> 00:23:12,333
And it's been pretty remarkable.

420
00:23:14,417 --> 00:23:17,167
The feedback we've gotten
has generally been,

421
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:20,167
particularly on this
issue, super encouraging.

422
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,167
It says,
"If we walk in the light,

423
00:23:22,250 --> 00:23:23,667
"as he is in the light,

424
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,583
we have fellowship
with one another."

425
00:23:25,667 --> 00:23:30,000
As people are honest, they get
closer, as opposed to faking it,

426
00:23:30,042 --> 00:23:34,167
playing roles,
hiding behind fig leaves.

427
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,375
As you're honest and say,
"Here's what I've done,

428
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:38,458
and here's what's
been done to me--"

429
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,292
and you do this
with your spouse,

430
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,583
you don't necessarily
do--you don't do this with

431
00:23:42,667 --> 00:23:45,500
strangers, or dangerous
people, or your abuser,

432
00:23:45,542 --> 00:23:48,000
but you do this with
your spouse, or your parent,

433
00:23:48,042 --> 00:23:50,667
or a biblical counselor,
or a godly church leader,

434
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:52,792
or a trustworthy friend.

435
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:54,583
You have fellowship.
You feel closer.

436
00:23:54,667 --> 00:23:57,500
It's been
really interesting this week.

437
00:23:57,542 --> 00:24:01,167
Emotionally, this has been
a pretty shipwrecked week for me

438
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:03,667
for a whole lot of reasons,
but all leading up

439
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:07,167
to having to teach--or
getting to teach this content.

440
00:24:07,208 --> 00:24:11,042
But I've had multiple women
walk up to me in stores,

441
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:15,667
in coffee shops, look me in
the eye, start crying and say,

442
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:20,542
"Tell Grace,
'Thank you for chapter 7.'"

443
00:24:20,625 --> 00:24:24,792
And they feel
a fellowship with her.

444
00:24:24,833 --> 00:24:30,875
One was a young woman who said,
you know, "That's my story,

445
00:24:30,958 --> 00:24:33,583
"and Grace told hers and
got help, so I'm telling mine,

446
00:24:33,667 --> 00:24:35,667
so I can get help."

447
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:38,167
Well, praise God for that.

448
00:24:38,250 --> 00:24:41,000
And so as we talk about sin
we've committed and sin

449
00:24:41,042 --> 00:24:44,000
that's been committed against
us, we walk in the light.

450
00:24:44,042 --> 00:24:45,750
We have fellowship
with one another.

451
00:24:45,833 --> 00:24:47,375
We actually build relationships.

452
00:24:47,458 --> 00:24:49,500
We get beyond the,
"How are you doing?"

453
00:24:49,542 --> 00:24:50,875
"Great.
How are you?"

454
00:24:50,958 --> 00:24:52,292
"Great."

455
00:24:52,333 --> 00:24:54,375
"Well, we're both great.
Glad that's over with.

456
00:24:54,458 --> 00:24:57,583
Have a nice life."

457
00:24:57,667 --> 00:24:59,583
One of the guys on
the film crew,

458
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,042
before the sermon, he asked,
"How are you doing?"

459
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:04,750
I said, "I'm not going to
lie to you, not well."

460
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:08,083
He was like, "I understand."

461
00:25:08,167 --> 00:25:11,083
"If we walk in the light,
as he is in the light,

462
00:25:11,167 --> 00:25:12,583
"we have fellowship
with one another,

463
00:25:12,667 --> 00:25:15,083
and the blood of Jesus his
Son cleanses us from--"

464
00:25:15,167 --> 00:25:16,500
how much sin?

465
00:25:16,542 --> 00:25:18,250
"All sin."

466
00:25:18,333 --> 00:25:20,000
"If we say we
have no sin--"

467
00:25:20,042 --> 00:25:21,750
"Oh, I've not done
anything too bad,

468
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,583
and nobody's done
anything bad to me."

469
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:26,167
"We deceive ourselves."

470
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:29,167
You can actually
start to believe that lie.

471
00:25:29,250 --> 00:25:31,667
"Nothing bad's happened to me,
and I haven't done anything

472
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,958
"real bad to them, so, you know,
thankfully, it's not a big deal.

473
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:36,375
"Our life is pretty easy.

474
00:25:36,458 --> 00:25:39,375
"Move along with the needy
people, who've got big issues,

475
00:25:39,458 --> 00:25:41,000
because ours is pretty simple."

476
00:25:41,042 --> 00:25:42,792
We deceive ourselves.

477
00:25:42,833 --> 00:25:45,083
Satan, in the Bible,
is called a deceiver.

478
00:25:45,167 --> 00:25:48,083
People can deceive
themselves, as well.

479
00:25:48,167 --> 00:25:50,583
"And the truth is not in us."

480
00:25:50,667 --> 00:25:55,250
We're not telling the truth.

481
00:25:55,333 --> 00:25:57,500
So, when it comes
to the sin we've committed,

482
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,458
and the sin that's
been committed against us,

483
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:02,458
we need to be truthful about
all of it, not diminish it.

484
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,500
People like
to partially confess their sin,

485
00:26:05,583 --> 00:26:07,500
or they like to partially
confess sin

486
00:26:07,542 --> 00:26:10,583
that's been committed
against them, because of shame.

487
00:26:10,667 --> 00:26:13,792
They don't want to
tell the whole truth.

488
00:26:13,833 --> 00:26:16,167
But God asks us
to tell the whole truth,

489
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:22,500
so that we can deal with reality
and not be self-deceived.

490
00:26:22,542 --> 00:26:25,750
And the key is that, "The blood
of Jesus his Son cleanses us

491
00:26:25,833 --> 00:26:27,667
from all sin."

492
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:30,375
And the idea here is this,
that because of the sins

493
00:26:30,458 --> 00:26:32,875
we've committed,
we all deserve death and hell.

494
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,250
And I know it's not
popular to say that,

495
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:37,458
and there's a lot of
places that'll tell you,

496
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:40,167
"You're basically a good person,
and don't really worry about it.

497
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:42,167
God loves everybody.
You're going to be fine."

498
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,583
Let me tell you this.

499
00:26:43,667 --> 00:26:45,792
Everybody is a bad person
and headed toward hell

500
00:26:45,833 --> 00:26:47,167
at breakneck speed.

501
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,583
Hell is the active wrath

502
00:26:48,667 --> 00:26:50,583
of a just and holy God
against evil.

503
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,292
And I praise God that he doesn't
look at this earth

504
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,292
and all of the injustice,
tyranny, oppression, rape,

505
00:26:55,333 --> 00:27:00,042
assault, and neglect, and say,
"Those are some good people."

506
00:27:00,125 --> 00:27:03,250
I'm glad that God
looks at it, as a father would,

507
00:27:03,333 --> 00:27:05,667
toward children that
were being assaulted and says,

508
00:27:05,708 --> 00:27:08,333
"That really grieves
and angers me,

509
00:27:08,417 --> 00:27:10,500
"and I cannot tolerate
that forever.

510
00:27:10,542 --> 00:27:15,458
It will come to an end."

511
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,833
Some of you are in grave danger.

512
00:27:19,917 --> 00:27:22,250
You are headed toward hell.

513
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:25,958
You are living
in the path of the wrath of God.

514
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,292
And the good news is
that God comes as Jesus Christ.

515
00:27:29,333 --> 00:27:31,583
God comes as a man.

516
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:35,458
He lives as we do,
yet without any sin,

517
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,875
and he substitutes
himself on the cross,

518
00:27:37,958 --> 00:27:41,792
and he suffers and dies
in our place for our sins,

519
00:27:41,833 --> 00:27:46,542
so that at the cross of
Jesus, justice and mercy kiss,

520
00:27:46,625 --> 00:27:53,500
and our sin is paid
for through the blood of Jesus,

521
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,792
through the blood of Jesus.

522
00:27:55,833 --> 00:27:57,667
So, friends, let me say this.

523
00:27:57,750 --> 00:28:00,333
There will be
justice for us all.

524
00:28:00,375 --> 00:28:03,833
It's either at the cross
of Jesus or in hell,

525
00:28:03,917 --> 00:28:06,500
and no one
is getting away with anything.

526
00:28:06,583 --> 00:28:10,083
And for those of you who are
victims of assault and abuse

527
00:28:10,167 --> 00:28:13,167
of various sorts and kinds,
in forgiving someone,

528
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,250
you're not saying it's okay.

529
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:19,500
What you're saying is you'll
leave it in the hands of God.

530
00:28:19,542 --> 00:28:21,875
You'll leave it
in the hands of God.

531
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:24,792
And that is either
Jesus died for it,

532
00:28:24,833 --> 00:28:27,958
or they will die and go
to hell for it. But either way,

533
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,667
it will be dealt with.

534
00:28:29,750 --> 00:28:32,000
And we're all sinners
by nature and choice,

535
00:28:32,042 --> 00:28:35,500
and we need to know that our
sin is such a big deal

536
00:28:35,542 --> 00:28:37,958
that it required
the death of God.

537
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,000
So, it's a great travesty
for even a victim to say,

538
00:28:41,042 --> 00:28:43,292
"Yes, what happened
to me did, in fact, occur,

539
00:28:43,333 --> 00:28:45,292
but it wasn't that
big of a deal."

540
00:28:45,333 --> 00:28:47,083
Yes, it was.

541
00:28:47,167 --> 00:28:48,833
God had to die for it.

542
00:28:48,917 --> 00:28:51,667
That's how big of a deal it is.

543
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:56,042
But Jesus can
and does forgive all sin.

544
00:28:56,125 --> 00:29:00,542
It doesn't matter
what you've done.

545
00:29:00,625 --> 00:29:04,042
Jesus can and does
forgive all sin,

546
00:29:04,125 --> 00:29:09,417
even the horrific sins of sexual
assault; yes, even toward women;

547
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:12,542
yes, even toward children.

548
00:29:12,625 --> 00:29:15,167
He doesn't just forgive people;
he changes them

549
00:29:15,208 --> 00:29:21,833
so that they stop sinning
and start serving.

550
00:29:21,917 --> 00:29:24,167
Do you know Jesus?

551
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:26,833
Is your sin forgiven,
or are you living in the path

552
00:29:26,917 --> 00:29:29,000
of the wrath of God?

553
00:29:29,083 --> 00:29:34,917
But Jesus does forgive all sin.

554
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:37,542
But we need to talk about it.

555
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,750
You need to talk
to God about it.

556
00:29:39,833 --> 00:29:42,167
That's that word,

557
00:29:42,208 --> 00:29:45,917
"We walk in the light."

558
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:49,500
It's being honest with God,
it's being honest with others;

559
00:29:49,583 --> 00:29:52,000
and if you're married, it's
being honest with your spouse.

560
00:29:52,083 --> 00:29:55,000
Who are you,
and what have you done?

561
00:29:55,083 --> 00:29:59,000
Number two,
Jesus takes all shame.

562
00:29:59,083 --> 00:30:03,833
One of my great frustrations
with gospel presentations is

563
00:30:03,875 --> 00:30:06,250
that it is said,
"You're a sinner,

564
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:08,667
"and if you repent of
sin and trust in Jesus,

565
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:10,292
he will save you."

566
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:13,250
That's absolutely true, but what
happens to those who are not

567
00:30:13,333 --> 00:30:18,167
just the sinners, but
the victims of others' sin?

568
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:21,250
What do you do?

569
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,042
What do you do when you're
the one who was beaten,

570
00:30:24,125 --> 00:30:26,042
when you were
the one who was betrayed,

571
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:28,042
when you were
the one who was molested,

572
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:30,042
when you were
the one who was raped?

573
00:30:30,125 --> 00:30:31,458
What do you do?

574
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:34,167
You don't repent of your sin.
You're the victim of sin.

575
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:35,583
You didn't sin.

576
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,083
You were the victim of sin.

577
00:30:37,167 --> 00:30:38,875
What do you do?

578
00:30:38,958 --> 00:30:42,333
And that is that Jesus
not only forgives sinners;

579
00:30:42,417 --> 00:30:44,750
he cleanses victims.

580
00:30:44,833 --> 00:30:46,875
And what he does,
he takes their shame.

581
00:30:46,958 --> 00:30:48,500
Because you know
what sin produces?

582
00:30:48,542 --> 00:30:50,042
Shame.

583
00:30:50,125 --> 00:30:51,792
And this can be sin
we've committed

584
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,292
or sin that's
committed against us.

585
00:30:53,333 --> 00:30:54,667
It creates shame.

586
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:56,667
We see this early
on in Genesis 2,

587
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:58,458
where God creates our
first parents perfect.

588
00:30:58,500 --> 00:31:01,542
And it says that they were
naked without any what?

589
00:31:01,625 --> 00:31:03,542
Shame.

590
00:31:03,625 --> 00:31:07,042
So, before sin enters
the world, there's no shame.

591
00:31:07,125 --> 00:31:10,083
As soon as they sin,
they cover themselves,

592
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:13,375
they hide from one another,
and they hide from God.

593
00:31:13,458 --> 00:31:15,000
Do you know what that is?

594
00:31:15,042 --> 00:31:16,500
Shame.

595
00:31:16,542 --> 00:31:19,875
"I don't want God to see me.
I don't want you to see me.

596
00:31:19,958 --> 00:31:21,750
I don't want to be known."

597
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:23,458
Because intimacy is
"into-me-see,"

598
00:31:23,500 --> 00:31:26,667
and they just
don't want to be seen.

599
00:31:26,750 --> 00:31:30,292
People who are ashamed, they
tend to withdraw, retreat,

600
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,667
hide, or they'll hide
behind, as I said,

601
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:36,500
a mask or an identity that
they assume and presume,

602
00:31:36,542 --> 00:31:39,667
as an effort of pretending who
they are and defending

603
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,083
the shame they feel.

604
00:31:43,167 --> 00:31:45,583
How many of you feel
shame by what you've done?

605
00:31:45,667 --> 00:31:49,542
How many of you feel shame
by what has been done to you?

606
00:31:49,625 --> 00:31:55,042
You just feel dirty.

607
00:31:55,125 --> 00:32:01,542
Every woman I've ever counseled,
who is a sexual assault victim,

608
00:32:01,625 --> 00:32:07,667
the first thing she did, after
being assaulted, was what?

609
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:11,667
Take a shower.

610
00:32:11,708 --> 00:32:14,875
I can't remember
a woman who hasn't said,

611
00:32:14,958 --> 00:32:16,833
"And I had to go take a shower."

612
00:32:16,917 --> 00:32:18,667
What is that?

613
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:23,750
It's that they feel, to use
the language of Genesis 34,

614
00:32:23,833 --> 00:32:25,542
in the story of Dinah,

615
00:32:25,625 --> 00:32:31,958
"defiled," unclean, dirty.

616
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,875
Hebrews 12:1-2,

617
00:32:35,958 --> 00:32:39,667
"Let us also
lay aside every weight."

618
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:42,083
Is your shame, the sin
committed against you,

619
00:32:42,167 --> 00:32:43,792
does it feel like a weight?

620
00:32:43,833 --> 00:32:46,958
Does it feel like
a taxing burden,

621
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:50,833
like an emotional anchor?

622
00:32:50,917 --> 00:32:53,375
"And the sin which
clings so closely,"

623
00:32:53,458 --> 00:32:58,292
does it always feel
like it's right there?

624
00:32:58,333 --> 00:33:00,833
"And let us run,"
not just limp, but,

625
00:33:00,917 --> 00:33:02,917
"run with endurance,"
that's perseverance,

626
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:08,875
keep going, "the race that is
set before us," that God has

627
00:33:08,958 --> 00:33:12,667
purposed for us in our life to
not only heal but to help others

628
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:15,250
be healed, through Jesus Christ.

629
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,083
Looking to who?

630
00:33:17,167 --> 00:33:18,750
Jesus.

631
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:21,250
See, if you're just looking
at yourself as a victim,

632
00:33:21,333 --> 00:33:26,167
or just looking at your abuser,
and you're not looking to Jesus,

633
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,833
you're not going
to be able to run.

634
00:33:29,917 --> 00:33:33,792
You're just going to limp for
the rest of your life.

635
00:33:33,833 --> 00:33:37,167
"The founder and perfecter
of our faith,

636
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,583
who for the joy that was
set before him,"

637
00:33:39,667 --> 00:33:43,375
Jesus, though it was painful,
and he shed his tears,

638
00:33:43,458 --> 00:33:46,667
he joyously saved sinners.

639
00:33:46,708 --> 00:33:50,458
He joyously takes shame,
"endured the cross,

640
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,458
despising the--"
What?

641
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:53,833
"Shame."

642
00:33:53,917 --> 00:33:57,042
We have a God--for those of you
who struggle with the shame of

643
00:33:57,125 --> 00:33:59,875
the sin that's been committed
by you or against you--

644
00:33:59,958 --> 00:34:03,750
we have a God who has come
into human history and has,

645
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,833
of his own volition,

646
00:34:06,875 --> 00:34:13,167
has chosen
to be shamed and victimized.

647
00:34:13,208 --> 00:34:18,500
Jesus was victimized--
emotionally, verbally,

648
00:34:18,542 --> 00:34:22,583
spiritually, physically abused.

649
00:34:22,667 --> 00:34:25,667
He was assaulted.

650
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:29,375
And he went to the cross,
and he was shamed.

651
00:34:29,458 --> 00:34:34,375
They said horrific things
about his character

652
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:39,667
that were completely untrue.

653
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:43,833
He was stripped, altogether--or
almost altogether--naked, I mean,

654
00:34:43,917 --> 00:34:46,542
so shameful for a man.

655
00:34:46,625 --> 00:34:48,292
He was condemned as a criminal.

656
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:50,458
He was beaten.
He was cursed upon.

657
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:52,750
He was spit upon.

658
00:34:52,833 --> 00:34:56,375
He was mocked.

659
00:34:56,458 --> 00:34:58,375
He was crucified.

660
00:34:58,458 --> 00:35:01,542
He was shamed.

661
00:35:01,625 --> 00:35:04,250
But the Bible says that
he went to the cross,

662
00:35:04,333 --> 00:35:05,958
despising the shame.

663
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:10,375
Some of your translations will
say, "scorning the shame."

664
00:35:10,458 --> 00:35:14,458
You sinners need to know that
when Jesus went to the cross,

665
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:16,083
he took your sin.

666
00:35:16,167 --> 00:35:18,833
You victims need to know,
when Jesus went to the cross,

667
00:35:18,917 --> 00:35:20,750
he took your shame.

668
00:35:20,833 --> 00:35:24,667
And they both died in
the body of Jesus that day.

669
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:28,167
And so there is forgiveness
of shame--of sin, rather,

670
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:30,875
and there is taking of shame
in the person and work

671
00:35:30,958 --> 00:35:32,500
of Jesus.

672
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:34,792
And I really, desperately,
as your pastor,

673
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:37,375
want you to know and embrace
this great truth,

674
00:35:37,458 --> 00:35:43,042
otherwise, you will feel
forgiven but ashamed,

675
00:35:43,125 --> 00:35:45,750
and you will limp along, rather
than running the race

676
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:48,292
that is set before you.

677
00:35:48,333 --> 00:35:53,583
And number three, Jesus
cleanses all defilement.

678
00:35:53,667 --> 00:35:56,167
The Bible, between
the Old and New Testament,

679
00:35:56,250 --> 00:35:58,583
has about a dozen words--

680
00:35:58,667 --> 00:36:03,167
defilement, filth, uncleanness--

681
00:36:03,208 --> 00:36:07,792
these are all words
denoting the staining effect

682
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:12,500
of sin, particularly that
committed against us.

683
00:36:12,542 --> 00:36:14,833
If you read the Old Testament,
and you wonder,

684
00:36:14,917 --> 00:36:17,792
"Why do they have to keep
cleaning their home and have

685
00:36:17,833 --> 00:36:21,583
"cleansing rituals and all of
this mechanism by which to rid

686
00:36:21,667 --> 00:36:26,958
"their homes and their diets,
and their garments of filth

687
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,250
and dirt?"

688
00:36:29,333 --> 00:36:33,250
It's all showing that
sin is like that.

689
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:36,167
Sin gets into everything,
and it makes it dirty,

690
00:36:36,208 --> 00:36:39,875
and it makes it defiled,
and it makes it disgusting.

691
00:36:39,958 --> 00:36:43,875
And as we labor to keep
our bodies and homes clean,

692
00:36:43,958 --> 00:36:49,958
so Jesus needs to cleanse us
from all of our unrighteousness.

693
00:36:53,417 --> 00:36:59,167
Some of you feel very
defiled, damaged, broken.

694
00:37:03,708 --> 00:37:07,125
And here's what 1 John 1:9 says,

695
00:37:07,167 --> 00:37:08,875
"If we confess
our sins--"

696
00:37:08,958 --> 00:37:14,083
Again, we talk about it with God
and godly, trustworthy people,

697
00:37:14,167 --> 00:37:17,667
beginning with our spouse,
I would hope and pray.

698
00:37:17,708 --> 00:37:20,375
He is what?

699
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,375
"He's faithful."

700
00:37:22,458 --> 00:37:25,792
And I can tell you, from
my life, my wife's life,

701
00:37:25,833 --> 00:37:28,333
and hundreds of people that
we've been able to serve

702
00:37:28,417 --> 00:37:31,375
in varying ways on these
issues over the years,

703
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:36,750
he is faithful. "--to
forgive us our sins--"

704
00:37:36,833 --> 00:37:39,000
So, whatever sins
you've committed,

705
00:37:39,042 --> 00:37:42,167
Jesus can and will forgive,
if, today, you turn from sin,

706
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,958
trust in him.

707
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:48,292
"And" to what?

708
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:52,000
"Cleanse us."

709
00:37:52,042 --> 00:37:54,500
See, the rape victim,
who climbs in the shower,

710
00:37:54,542 --> 00:38:00,042
what they really want is Jesus,
but they just don't know

711
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:03,417
how to get clean to
the level of the soul,

712
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:09,542
so they go as far as they can,
which is cleansing of the body.

713
00:38:11,417 --> 00:38:13,875
"To forgive us our sins
and to cleanse us from

714
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:16,500
all unrighteousness."

715
00:38:16,542 --> 00:38:20,000
And for you victims,
I want you just to memorize,

716
00:38:20,042 --> 00:38:26,542
"cleanse from all
unrighteousness," all of it.

717
00:38:26,625 --> 00:38:29,667
And what that means is you may
even have repressed memories

718
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:32,458
or disassociation,
and you're doing something,

719
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:35,000
and all of a sudden
a memory comes back.

720
00:38:35,042 --> 00:38:38,167
And you think, "Man, I thought I
dealt with this, but it's back,

721
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,542
"or it's something I didn't
know, and now I do know."

722
00:38:41,625 --> 00:38:44,667
I talked to a victim,
a woman, not long ago,

723
00:38:44,750 --> 00:38:47,542
and somebody just walked up
behind her and just, it was

724
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,750
a friend that just put a hand on
her shoulder, and she absolutely

725
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:54,083
fell to the floor weeping
bitterly, did not know why.

726
00:38:54,167 --> 00:38:57,000
It triggered a memory that she
had not remembered in years

727
00:38:57,042 --> 00:39:02,917
of something that had happened
to her, that was assaulting.

728
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,625
And it's cleansing from all
the unrighteousness, all of it.

729
00:39:08,667 --> 00:39:11,417
And the way this works itself
out in the Bible is

730
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,333
symbolic acts.

731
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:16,625
The people of God are often
told, "Wash your clothes,"

732
00:39:16,667 --> 00:39:18,167
to show what Jesus does.

733
00:39:18,208 --> 00:39:21,250
I want you, every time
you do your laundry,

734
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,542
just to remind yourself
Jesus cleanses

735
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,250
from all unrighteousness.

736
00:39:26,333 --> 00:39:28,208
Every time you do your dishes,
Jesus cleanses

737
00:39:28,292 --> 00:39:30,542
from all unrighteousness.

738
00:39:30,625 --> 00:39:32,542
Every time you sweep
or vacuum the floor,

739
00:39:32,625 --> 00:39:37,458
Jesus cleanses from
all unrighteousness.

740
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:41,542
This is shown, as well,
in Christian baptism,

741
00:39:41,625 --> 00:39:44,333
that Jesus lived, died,
was buried, and rose.

742
00:39:44,417 --> 00:39:47,458
And as water cleanses
us from filth,

743
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:52,750
Jesus cleanses us from
all unrighteousness.

744
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:54,167
As well, in the Bible,

745
00:39:54,208 --> 00:39:56,667
the people of God often wear
what color?

746
00:39:56,708 --> 00:39:58,750
White.

747
00:39:58,833 --> 00:40:01,042
Do you ever wonder why?

748
00:40:01,125 --> 00:40:06,833
It's to show that Jesus cleanses
from all unrighteousness.

749
00:40:06,917 --> 00:40:09,958
So, even the church is typified
in Revelation 19

750
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,375
at the end of the age
as like a bride.

751
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:15,083
Jesus is like a groom,
and there's this enormous

752
00:40:15,167 --> 00:40:19,875
celebration and wedding feast
that ends human history.

753
00:40:19,958 --> 00:40:23,375
And it says that fine,
white linen, pure and clean,

754
00:40:23,458 --> 00:40:26,792
was given her to wear.

755
00:40:26,833 --> 00:40:29,083
Ladies, it doesn't matter what
you've done

756
00:40:29,167 --> 00:40:31,083
or what's been done to you.

757
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,875
On your wedding day,
you wear what?

758
00:40:33,958 --> 00:40:36,167
You wear white, if
you are in Christ,

759
00:40:36,250 --> 00:40:38,750
because if you are in
Christ, you are clean.

760
00:40:38,833 --> 00:40:40,750
That's your identity.

761
00:40:40,833 --> 00:40:44,167
You're not determined by what
you've done

762
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,833
or what's been done to you.

763
00:40:45,917 --> 00:40:48,458
You're determined by what
Jesus has done for you,

764
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:52,292
and he cleanses us from
all unrighteousness.

765
00:40:52,333 --> 00:40:56,333
This is why even the people
of God, in the Old Testament,

766
00:40:56,417 --> 00:40:58,792
they would go to the temple.

767
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,708
I've had the privilege
of being there,

768
00:41:00,792 --> 00:41:03,333
at least at the site where
the temple used to reside,

769
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:05,333
and it's literally
a city on a hill.

770
00:41:05,417 --> 00:41:08,792
It's high and exalted,
and the temple is at the top

771
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:13,667
of this rock, highly visible.

772
00:41:13,708 --> 00:41:15,875
And there were certain
psalms of ascent,

773
00:41:15,958 --> 00:41:19,042
that the people would sing, as
they would go to worship God

774
00:41:19,125 --> 00:41:20,583
and deal with sin.

775
00:41:20,667 --> 00:41:23,500
And at the base of the mountain,
before they would ascend

776
00:41:23,542 --> 00:41:25,792
to worship God, singing
various psalms of ascent,

777
00:41:25,833 --> 00:41:28,375
they would first stop, and
they would wash their clothes,

778
00:41:28,458 --> 00:41:30,667
and they'd wash their body,
and they'd put on

779
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:35,500
fresh, white linen, and then
they would go to worship God.

780
00:41:35,542 --> 00:41:40,542
Imagine seeing tens of thousands
of people wearing white.

781
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:43,292
That's to remind us all:
Jesus cleanses

782
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:47,667
from all unrighteousness.

783
00:41:47,750 --> 00:41:53,792
For those who are the spouse of
an assault victim,

784
00:41:53,833 --> 00:41:57,167
number one,

785
00:41:57,250 --> 00:42:00,667
God has not given you
an affliction;

786
00:42:00,708 --> 00:42:02,667
he's given you a mission.

787
00:42:02,708 --> 00:42:04,708
Or I should say it this way:

788
00:42:04,792 --> 00:42:06,458
God has not given
us an affliction;

789
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:08,875
he's given us a mission.

790
00:42:08,958 --> 00:42:13,083
I've got two daughters

791
00:42:13,167 --> 00:42:18,583
that I absolutely
cherish and adore.

792
00:42:18,667 --> 00:42:24,167
And God has daughters that
he cherishes and adores.

793
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:29,833
And if he would ask some of you
men to marry and love

794
00:42:29,917 --> 00:42:36,083
and serve those women, it is
not an affliction;

795
00:42:36,167 --> 00:42:41,667
it is a mission that
the Father has sent you on,

796
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:44,792
because he's trusting you
to love his daughter

797
00:42:44,833 --> 00:42:48,292
with his affection.

798
00:42:48,333 --> 00:42:51,333
And in our selfish
moments, we can think,

799
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:54,792
"This is more difficult
than some might experience.

800
00:42:54,833 --> 00:42:57,833
This is not what I
would've hoped for."

801
00:42:57,917 --> 00:43:03,042
We should, instead, thank God
that he's trusted us with such

802
00:43:03,125 --> 00:43:09,250
a sacred mission and not in any
way view it as an affliction.

803
00:43:09,333 --> 00:43:15,792
Number two, the affection
and the intimacy takes longer,

804
00:43:15,833 --> 00:43:21,292
but it goes deeper, because
for someone who has been hurt,

805
00:43:21,333 --> 00:43:25,458
they will be reticent, cautious
to really trust someone,

806
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:28,375
even their spouse.

807
00:43:28,458 --> 00:43:34,583
And so it will take longer,
but it will go deeper,

808
00:43:34,667 --> 00:43:37,500
because they will trust you
in a way

809
00:43:37,542 --> 00:43:40,750
they've never trusted anyone
and be vulnerable with you

810
00:43:40,833 --> 00:43:45,958
in a way that has
only been betrayed.

811
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:49,083
And for those of
you who might ask,

812
00:43:49,167 --> 00:43:51,792
God does not cause
these things to happen,

813
00:43:51,833 --> 00:43:55,583
but he uses them for good.

814
00:43:55,667 --> 00:43:58,000
God does not cause
these things to happen,

815
00:43:58,042 --> 00:44:00,542
but he will use them for good.

816
00:44:00,625 --> 00:44:05,167
And that's why Grace
wrote the chapter.

817
00:44:05,208 --> 00:44:11,750
Father God, as I bring Grace
out, I pray for our church,

818
00:44:11,833 --> 00:44:15,542
that we would be a safe place,

819
00:44:15,625 --> 00:44:22,375
a helpful place,
a healing place.

820
00:44:22,458 --> 00:44:26,500
God, for those who have just
realized that this is their

821
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:31,083
story, I pray for the time
and energy it's going to take

822
00:44:31,167 --> 00:44:34,333
to process this and trustworthy
people, including their spouse,

823
00:44:34,417 --> 00:44:39,000
to talk about this with.

824
00:44:39,042 --> 00:44:42,583
And, God, it is an epidemic.

825
00:44:42,667 --> 00:44:48,042
It's a growing epidemic, so
we pray against the enemy,

826
00:44:48,125 --> 00:44:50,875
his servants, their
works and effects.

827
00:44:50,958 --> 00:44:53,667
We pray for the power of
the gospel of Jesus Christ

828
00:44:53,750 --> 00:44:56,292
to do its work,
and we pray that

829
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,583
the people of God
would be a means

830
00:44:58,667 --> 00:45:04,208
by which the grace of God
and the love of God is shared.

831
00:45:04,292 --> 00:45:07,458
I thank you for Grace's bravery
and boldness

832
00:45:07,500 --> 00:45:10,167
and her friendship with me.

833
00:45:10,208 --> 00:45:14,542
God, I thank you that
I get to be her husband,

834
00:45:14,625 --> 00:45:19,375
and I pray for the men
in the church, that are single,

835
00:45:19,458 --> 00:45:23,667
that we would not see
them make any victims.

836
00:45:23,750 --> 00:45:26,542
I pray for the men
in the church, who are married,

837
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:29,875
that they would not
make any victims.

838
00:45:29,958 --> 00:45:32,875
And I pray for the people in
the church, men and women,

839
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:35,875
who are victims, that they
would know, in Christ,

840
00:45:35,958 --> 00:45:39,875
they are forgiven; in Christ,
their shame is scorned;

841
00:45:39,958 --> 00:45:42,292
and, in Christ, they are clean.

842
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:45,083
In Jesus' name, amen.

843
00:45:45,167 --> 00:45:46,958
Thank you for
joining me, sweetie.

844
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:49,667
Rather than doing Q&A today, I
just don't think emotionally

845
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,167
I could handle that,
to be honest with you,

846
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,333
and I didn't want
to expose you

847
00:45:55,417 --> 00:46:00,208
to that kind of situation.

848
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:05,042
So, thanks for
writing the chapter.

849
00:46:05,125 --> 00:46:10,167
I think you did a great job,
and thanks for being my friend.

850
00:46:10,208 --> 00:46:13,167
Thanks for walking through
this whole process with me.

851
00:46:13,250 --> 00:46:19,667
I would do anything for you.
I would.

852
00:46:19,750 --> 00:46:25,000
Let's start with, how did it
feel for you or what concerns

853
00:46:25,042 --> 00:46:30,333
or apprehensions did you
have once, you know,

854
00:46:30,417 --> 00:46:32,000
we kind of understood
everything,

855
00:46:32,042 --> 00:46:33,875
and then you
started working toward

856
00:46:33,958 --> 00:46:35,500
getting in a Redemption Group,

857
00:46:35,542 --> 00:46:38,167
and talking with people,
and working that through?

858
00:46:38,250 --> 00:46:41,000
What was that like for you?

859
00:46:41,042 --> 00:46:45,750
There was a lot
of fears involved.

860
00:46:45,833 --> 00:46:49,458
I was always
a very private, quiet person,

861
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:53,250
and so when God
started revealing and

862
00:46:53,333 --> 00:46:56,458
opening my eyes to some of
the things that had been--

863
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,667
had happened to me--it was
a big deal for me

864
00:47:00,708 --> 00:47:03,333
to even share it with you.

865
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:07,125
And so the thought of continuing
to share that with people for

866
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:13,500
healing was pretty frightening,
and just to not keep those

867
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:17,250
things private, and to think
that any healing could possibly

868
00:47:17,333 --> 00:47:22,333
come from more discussion
was confusing to me.

869
00:47:22,417 --> 00:47:26,083
It seemed like you could just
confess it, or talk about it,

870
00:47:26,167 --> 00:47:29,667
and then turn the page, and
you'd be fine, and that was it,

871
00:47:29,708 --> 00:47:34,000
but God had so much more healing
to do in the process

872
00:47:34,042 --> 00:47:36,333
of working it through.

873
00:47:36,417 --> 00:47:40,875
So, as I was entering into
a group with other women,

874
00:47:40,958 --> 00:47:44,667
some who I knew, some who I
didn't really know,

875
00:47:44,708 --> 00:47:47,792
it was a super vulnerable place
for me.

876
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:50,750
There were many times, where
I wanted to quit and say,

877
00:47:50,833 --> 00:47:55,500
"This is too hard," and that
fear of rejection from people

878
00:47:55,542 --> 00:47:59,000
was big for me.

879
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,625
It's because of lots of
relationships throughout

880
00:48:01,667 --> 00:48:05,458
my life, and so the thought of
telling people this and then

881
00:48:05,500 --> 00:48:09,958
the rejection possibility
that would happen.

882
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:13,583
And so just sharing and getting
in that group actually was

883
00:48:13,667 --> 00:48:17,875
a healing process, because as
we each shared our story,

884
00:48:17,958 --> 00:48:23,167
and things that had happened,
and different aspects,

885
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:26,667
it made me realize
that I wasn't alone.

886
00:48:26,750 --> 00:48:30,083
And I knew I wasn't, because
I had the Lord, and I had you,

887
00:48:30,167 --> 00:48:33,583
but there's just something, I
think, for women specifically,

888
00:48:33,667 --> 00:48:37,000
but for all of us in
general, living in community,

889
00:48:37,042 --> 00:48:42,083
it really does help us want to
be strengthened in that journey

890
00:48:42,167 --> 00:48:46,500
of healing, and so just sharing
that--and the women were sharing

891
00:48:46,542 --> 00:48:48,875
their stories, and I couldn't
relate to every detail

892
00:48:48,958 --> 00:48:50,292
of theirs.

893
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:52,333
They couldn't relate to
every detail of mine,

894
00:48:52,417 --> 00:48:54,167
but there were pieces
in everyone's story,

895
00:48:54,208 --> 00:48:58,583
whether it was shame or just
wanting to suppress the truth,

896
00:48:58,667 --> 00:49:00,958
or embarrassment.

897
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,167
There were lots of different
elements that we could

898
00:49:03,208 --> 00:49:05,667
each relate to in each
other's stories.

899
00:49:05,708 --> 00:49:08,542
And so it just, it was really
helpful to have people

900
00:49:08,625 --> 00:49:12,833
talk through that
in a group setting.

901
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:15,500
For those who may be
unfamiliar with it,

902
00:49:15,583 --> 00:49:18,167
this is why we started
Redemption Groups,

903
00:49:18,208 --> 00:49:19,750
quite frankly.

904
00:49:19,833 --> 00:49:25,167
We wanted to have a Bible-based,
Jesus-focused, church-connected

905
00:49:25,208 --> 00:49:29,167
way of helping those who
have been abused, addicted,

906
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:31,042
or have deep hurts and wounds,

907
00:49:31,125 --> 00:49:33,000
and so I know you
brought it out.

908
00:49:33,083 --> 00:49:36,000
Pastor Mike Wilkerson,
who's a friend of mine,

909
00:49:36,083 --> 00:49:38,458
and you're good friends
with his wife, Trisha,

910
00:49:38,500 --> 00:49:40,958
who's been a good friend
to you--he wrote the book,

911
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:43,833
"Redemption," and it serves
as kind of the basis for our

912
00:49:43,875 --> 00:49:47,542
Redemption Groups, and we really
appreciate them doing that work

913
00:49:47,625 --> 00:49:49,750
for us, and we asked
them to do that,

914
00:49:49,833 --> 00:49:52,458
so that Mars Hill
could be a place that we could

915
00:49:52,500 --> 00:49:53,833
establish groups to help people.

916
00:49:53,917 --> 00:49:56,542
I think over 700 people have
been through Redemption Groups,

917
00:49:56,625 --> 00:49:58,625
and at least that many
in other churches,

918
00:49:58,667 --> 00:50:01,125
as we're hoping to set up
Redemption Groups in other

919
00:50:01,167 --> 00:50:03,667
churches under the leadership
of Pastor Mike and others.

920
00:50:03,708 --> 00:50:06,833
Maybe take a few moments
and explain to people

921
00:50:06,875 --> 00:50:08,458
what a Redemption Group is.

922
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:10,167
It's different than
a Community Group.

923
00:50:10,250 --> 00:50:13,375
A Community Group meets ongoing
and discusses the content

924
00:50:13,458 --> 00:50:15,292
of the sermon.

925
00:50:15,333 --> 00:50:17,667
Maybe explain Redemption Groups
and how they work with

926
00:50:17,708 --> 00:50:19,375
Community Groups.

927
00:50:19,458 --> 00:50:21,750
Yeah, a Redemption Group
starts out with a weekend

928
00:50:21,833 --> 00:50:25,958
of training and getting to hear
from other leaders and people

929
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,667
who have similar experiences,
and then it goes for about

930
00:50:29,750 --> 00:50:35,167
a quarter every week, and it's
based off the story of Exodus

931
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:39,167
in the Bible, so it's
a very biblical training,

932
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:41,583
but it's also very practical.

933
00:50:41,667 --> 00:50:46,458
He talks through deliverance and
how God wants to deliver us from

934
00:50:46,500 --> 00:50:50,667
the slavery of sin, either that
we've committed

935
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,958
or that's been committed
against us.

936
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,792
And then he talks--it talks
through the ransom that God

937
00:50:55,833 --> 00:51:00,208
has already paid, so that we can
experience the next topic

938
00:51:00,292 --> 00:51:02,000
of renewal.

939
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:04,917
And all those things
are throughout

940
00:51:05,000 --> 00:51:07,833
the Redemption Group training.

941
00:51:07,917 --> 00:51:11,083
You get to continually hear
real stories of people

942
00:51:11,167 --> 00:51:14,667
that have walked through these
painful processes,

943
00:51:14,750 --> 00:51:17,375
and then you break off
into smaller groups,

944
00:51:17,458 --> 00:51:20,292
that they prayerfully
put people into.

945
00:51:20,333 --> 00:51:22,375
They have a leader
and an apprentice

946
00:51:22,458 --> 00:51:24,875
in the group that walk people
through the stories

947
00:51:24,958 --> 00:51:26,833
and how to talk to each other,

948
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,667
not hurt each other
more through comments,

949
00:51:29,708 --> 00:51:33,833
but to receive and love
each other through it,

950
00:51:33,917 --> 00:51:36,167
so it's a very
relational process.

951
00:51:36,250 --> 00:51:39,833
You get to know people that
you knew nothing about before.

952
00:51:39,917 --> 00:51:44,875
And then you continue to just
walk through that process.

953
00:51:44,958 --> 00:51:47,083
And then at the end,
they celebrate,

954
00:51:47,167 --> 00:51:50,750
have a celebration time, just
as Mark has said just to wear

955
00:51:50,833 --> 00:51:54,583
white, you know, celebrate, have
a feast that we get to celebrate

956
00:51:54,667 --> 00:51:57,167
what God has done in
the renewal process,

957
00:51:57,208 --> 00:51:59,958
and not that it's ended
after that quarter--

958
00:52:00,083 --> 00:52:04,042
you will continue, but you
continue under the auspices

959
00:52:04,125 --> 00:52:05,833
of a new identity.

960
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,667
You're not the abuse victim;

961
00:52:07,750 --> 00:52:09,667
you are a renewed
person in Christ,

962
00:52:09,708 --> 00:52:11,875
and he wants to
continue to heal you.

963
00:52:11,958 --> 00:52:14,250
And so the identity
piece is a huge part,

964
00:52:14,333 --> 00:52:17,083
getting rid of the idols and
walking in your new identity

965
00:52:17,167 --> 00:52:19,250
in Christ.

966
00:52:19,333 --> 00:52:21,875
What does it mean for you
that we've got Redemption Groups

967
00:52:21,958 --> 00:52:23,792
at Mars Hill?

968
00:52:23,833 --> 00:52:26,792
Oh, it means the world,
because I know that people

969
00:52:26,833 --> 00:52:30,833
can really experience healing,
and they don't have to be stuck

970
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:37,333
in shame and the pain of being
a sexual assault victim.

971
00:52:37,417 --> 00:52:41,875
They can help other people,
once they've been trained.

972
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:44,750
It's just, it's
a continual process for them.

973
00:52:44,833 --> 00:52:48,375
And, yeah, so many people
don't know what to say,

974
00:52:48,458 --> 00:52:52,042
when they hear of
sexual assault stories,

975
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:56,667
and so this is an essential part
for our church to come in

976
00:52:56,708 --> 00:52:59,750
and love people
who feel unloved.

977
00:52:59,833 --> 00:53:02,667
So, it means the world to me
that we could have

978
00:53:02,708 --> 00:53:04,833
such a resource,
because so many people

979
00:53:04,875 --> 00:53:06,917
didn't know what to say to me,
either.

980
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,000
Yeah.

981
00:53:09,042 --> 00:53:14,292
What counsel would you give for
a spouse, a friend, a parent,

982
00:53:14,333 --> 00:53:17,667
who knows someone that this
is part of their story,

983
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:21,875
or somebody confides in them
this is part of their story?

984
00:53:21,958 --> 00:53:25,083
What would be helpful for them
to say and do and unhelpful

985
00:53:25,167 --> 00:53:28,000
for them to say and do?

986
00:53:28,042 --> 00:53:32,500
Well, I think praying for
them, being a good listener,

987
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:36,667
being someone they can
trust, a confidante,

988
00:53:36,708 --> 00:53:39,500
not someone who's going to go
and spread what they've confided

989
00:53:39,542 --> 00:53:46,000
in you, just to remind them
of God's love for them,

990
00:53:46,042 --> 00:53:50,292
to remind them of his desire
for healing and renewal,

991
00:53:50,333 --> 00:53:54,167
and to cleanse from
all unrighteousness.

992
00:53:54,250 --> 00:53:56,875
I needed to be reminded
of those things regularly,

993
00:53:56,958 --> 00:54:01,208
because as new memories or lies

994
00:54:01,292 --> 00:54:04,750
try to invade
during the healing process,

995
00:54:04,833 --> 00:54:09,792
the truth needs to be spoken,
and not in a just an aloof way

996
00:54:09,833 --> 00:54:13,292
or unfeeling way,
but a way that is genuine,

997
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:16,750
and even just
hugging the person,

998
00:54:16,833 --> 00:54:19,667
if they're okay with that, if
it's someone that's, you know,

999
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:23,292
a girlfriend to another
gal, or your wife.

1000
00:54:23,333 --> 00:54:27,333
I think those are just important
ways to really help that person

1001
00:54:27,417 --> 00:54:29,333
see that you do care.

1002
00:54:29,417 --> 00:54:33,042
And if they need help, help
them into a Redemption Group.

1003
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:35,458
Help them into a community
that's trusting

1004
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:37,458
or a biblical counselor,

1005
00:54:37,500 --> 00:54:39,958
if you're not
in the Mars Hill community,

1006
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,083
praying with them,
praying over them,

1007
00:54:43,167 --> 00:54:45,667
checking in on them to make sure
that they're okay

1008
00:54:45,708 --> 00:54:48,083
in the healing process.

1009
00:54:48,167 --> 00:54:53,583
I had many friends that just
regularly would text me or call

1010
00:54:53,667 --> 00:54:56,750
and say, you know, "How
can I pray for you today?

1011
00:54:56,833 --> 00:54:58,792
What is your struggle today?"

1012
00:54:58,833 --> 00:55:01,042
And they would just
pray for me right then,

1013
00:55:01,125 --> 00:55:03,458
and they would pray for
me throughout the weeks.

1014
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:05,500
Just not rejecting me was huge.

1015
00:55:05,583 --> 00:55:11,167
And then, yeah, just
being good listeners.

1016
00:55:11,250 --> 00:55:13,375
I think I'm going
to end it there.

1017
00:55:13,458 --> 00:55:16,667
I don't think
I can do any more.

1018
00:55:16,708 --> 00:55:20,750
We're going to
transition at this point.

1019
00:55:20,833 --> 00:55:24,583
We'll collect our offering, and
that is to forward the ministry

1020
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:28,167
of Jesus, and we want
people to get help.

1021
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,542
Since we've recently grown
by 5,000 people in 2 weeks,

1022
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:34,875
we have
a whole lot of people to help,

1023
00:55:34,958 --> 00:55:36,792
and so we appreciate
your support,

1024
00:55:36,833 --> 00:55:38,542
prayerfully and financially.

1025
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:40,750
If you're new or want
to get connected,

1026
00:55:40,833 --> 00:55:43,667
give us that visitor card,
because we really want to follow

1027
00:55:43,750 --> 00:55:47,292
up with you and do anything
we can to connect to you.

1028
00:55:47,333 --> 00:55:49,292
So, if you put that
in the offering,

1029
00:55:49,333 --> 00:55:51,333
that'll enable us to serve you.

1030
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:54,458
We'll take Communion, which is
remembering the broken body

1031
00:55:54,500 --> 00:55:56,667
and shed blood of Jesus.

1032
00:55:56,750 --> 00:56:00,250
The blood of Jesus cleanses
from all unrighteousness.

1033
00:56:00,333 --> 00:56:02,667
And as you take Communion,
you're publicly saying,

1034
00:56:02,708 --> 00:56:07,042
"He died, so that I could
be forgiven and cleansed."

1035
00:56:07,125 --> 00:56:11,458
And it's a very powerful public
identification with Jesus.

1036
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:14,042
And, lastly,
we're going to sing.

1037
00:56:14,125 --> 00:56:18,542
And singing for us, today,
is a way of praying.

1038
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:24,500
It's working out what the heart
is feeling, through the voice.

1039
00:56:24,542 --> 00:56:27,167
And so, as we sing, we're
praying collectively

1040
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:29,375
as the people of God, today,

1041
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:32,833
some praying
and grieving for ourselves,

1042
00:56:32,917 --> 00:56:36,500
and some for those we
know and love, or some for both.

1043
00:56:36,542 --> 00:56:39,458
And so, yeah, sweetie,
if you'd be willing,

1044
00:56:39,500 --> 00:56:41,750
maybe just close
our time in prayer.

1045
00:56:41,833 --> 00:56:44,833
I'd appreciate that.

1046
00:56:44,917 --> 00:56:47,083
Lord, thank you.

1047
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:52,583
Thank you for giving me
the strength to write this story

1048
00:56:52,667 --> 00:56:58,083
that you are still weaving
and playing out in my life.

1049
00:56:58,167 --> 00:57:02,417
Thank you that you are taking
it to help other people,

1050
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:04,750
and I pray that you'd
continue to do that.

1051
00:57:04,833 --> 00:57:10,500
I pray that men and women who
have sexual assault in their

1052
00:57:10,542 --> 00:57:17,000
history, Lord, that they would
just move toward the release

1053
00:57:17,042 --> 00:57:21,500
from the shackles that
it causes for them.

1054
00:57:21,542 --> 00:57:25,000
Lord, I pray
against the enemy's lies

1055
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:29,875
and division of community
for them.

1056
00:57:29,958 --> 00:57:32,583
Lord, I pray that
they would trust you

1057
00:57:32,667 --> 00:57:35,042
as their Heavenly Father,

1058
00:57:35,125 --> 00:57:38,750
to be their source for
their identity, and their joy,

1059
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:41,000
and their healing.

1060
00:57:41,042 --> 00:57:47,000
Lord, I thank you that you don't
let us just continue

1061
00:57:47,042 --> 00:57:52,083
broken and unhealed, that you
desire so much more.

1062
00:57:52,167 --> 00:57:56,958
And so I pray for that path
for all of us, in Jesus' name.

1063
00:57:57,000 --> 00:57:59,167
Thanks.
